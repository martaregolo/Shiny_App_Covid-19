# Dashboard Shiny

For my master project, I design and implement a dashboard in R Shiny for the visualization of all informations about the COVID-19 epidemic. 
I use three tools of the Exploratory Data Analysis: a leaflet map, a bar plot, and a time series.
Moreover, I use the control charts, statistical process control tools, to monitor the path of some statistics.

The app is available here:
